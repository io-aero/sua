"""Vector3d module.

This module defines the Vector3D class, which represents a 3D vector
with x, y, and z components. It provides various methods for performing
common operations on 3D vectors, such as calculating the magnitude,
dot product, cross product, normalization, rotation, and translation.

Classes:
    Vector3D: Represents a 3D vector with x, y, and z components.

Examples:
    v = Vector3D(1, 2, 3)

    magnitude = v.magnitude()

    normalized = v.normalize()

    dot_product = v.dot_product(other_vector)

    cross_product = v.cross_product(other_vector)

    v.rotate(45, 'z')

    v.translate(2, 3, 4)
